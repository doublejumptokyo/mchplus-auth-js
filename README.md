# Authentication API for MCH Plus

This API connects to the authentication of [MCH Plus](https://www.mch.plus/), the blockchain game publishing service of [doublejump.tokyo](https://www.doublejump.tokyo/).

Please read the documentation below for how to use the API and which endpoints are exposed.

## Installation

### Npm

```bash
npm install mchplus-auth-js
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add mchplus-auth-js
```

### IMPORTANT: Breaking changes from version `0.1.1`

Since version `0.1.1`, `mchplus-auth-js` needs a provider instead of a web3 instance. This allows projects to freely choose between `web3.js` or `ethers.js`.

_Note_: `mchplus-auth-js` uses `ethers.js` under the hood.

## Usage(> `0.1.1`)

```js
import MchplusAuth from 'mchplus-auth-js'

const clientId = 'xxx'
const provider = // your user's provider
const env = 'sand' || 'prod' // env can be either sand or prod
const lang = 'en' // set your user's language here

const auth = new MchplusAuth(clientId, provider, env, lang)

// call methods here
```

## Usage(< `0.1.1`)

```js
import MchplusAuth from 'mchplus-auth-js'

const clientId = 'xxx'
const web3 = // your user's web3 instance
const env = 'sand' || 'prod' // env can be either sand or prod
const lang = 'en' // set your user's language here

const auth = new MchplusAuth(clientId, web3, env, lang)

// call methods here
```

## Authentication API

### Authenticate a user with their Ethereum address

Users sign up and log into the game with their Ethereum address. The `signAuth` logs in the user (or creates a new account if first login) and signs a Ethereum transaction with the public key.

```js
await auth.signAuth(callbackUrl);
```

## Verify Phone Number API

### Connect a user's phone number to their account

MCH Plus offers a phone number verification to protect our games from multiple accounts. The account verification has 2 steps:

1. Type in a user's phone number to receive a text message or call with the Authentication Pin.

```js
const number = "+8108092624621";
const isCall = false; // if true, user will get called instead of text message

await auth.submitNumber(number, isCall);
```

2. Type in the Authentication Pin and sign a transaction with the public key.

```js
const code = "xxxxxx"; // the frontend should have an input field

await auth.confirmNumber(code);
```

### Helper Functions

The API also provides some helper functions to make the frontend development easier:

Return a list of available regions and their country codes:

```js
await auth.getNumberRegions();
```

## QR code generation API for login

Generates a QR code for the user to log into the game.

```js
await auth.getQRCode(callbackUrl, state);
```

## Get Client Info API

You can get the values of the terms of use and privacy policy associated with the client_id.

```js
await auth.getClientInfo();
```
